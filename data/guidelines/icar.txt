ICAR AGRICULTURAL GUIDELINES - INDIAN CROP WATER MANAGEMENT

========================
WATER MANAGEMENT FOR INDIAN CONDITIONS
========================

RICE CULTIVATION - INDIAN VARIETIES

Water Requirements (Indian Conditions):
- Indian rice varieties adapted to monsoon patterns
- Water need varies with variety: Short duration (80-90 days), Medium (110-120 days), Long (130-140 days)

1. Initial Stage (Transplanting + 20 days)
   - Maintain 5cm standing water
   - 75-85 liters/hectare/day
   - Critical for root establishment

2. Tillering to Booting
   - Increase to 7-10cm water depth
   - 95-105 liters/hectare/day
   - Alternate wetting and drying can save water

3. Flowering to Maturity
   - Keep 5cm water continuously
   - 115-125 liters/hectare/day
   - Most sensitive to water stress

Water Saving Techniques (ICAR Recommended):
- System of Rice Intensification (SRI): Save 30-40% water
- Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD): Save 15-25% water
- Direct Seeded Rice (DSR): Save 20-35% water

========================
WHEAT - NORTH INDIA CONDITIONS
========================

Rabi Season (Winter) Crop:
- Sowing: October-November
- Harvest: March-April
- Less rainfall dependency

Irrigation Schedule:

1. Crown Root Initiation (20-25 DAS)
   - First critical irrigation
   - 40-50 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture: 50%

2. Tillering Stage
   - Second irrigation
   - 55-70 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture: 55%

3. Jointing Stage
   - Third irrigation
   - 60-75 liters/hectare/day
   - Important for spike development

4. Flowering and Grain Filling
   - Fourth and fifth irrigation
   - 75-90 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture: 60%
   - Critical for grain weight

ICAR Recommendation: 4-6 irrigations for wheat in North India

========================
MAIZE - KHARIF AND RABI SEASONS
========================

Kharif (Monsoon) Maize:
- Higher humidity, some rainfall
- Reduced irrigation need
- 60-80 liters/hectare/day during critical stages

Rabi (Winter) Maize:
- Full irrigation required
- 70-95 liters/hectare/day

Critical Stages for Irrigation:
1. Knee-high stage (VT)
2. Tasseling and Silking (R1) - MOST CRITICAL
3. Grain filling (R3-R5)

Water Stress Impact:
- At flowering: 40-50% yield loss possible
- At grain filling: 20-30% yield loss

========================
SOIL MOISTURE MONITORING
========================

Field Capacity vs Permanent Wilting Point:
- Light soils (Sandy): Irrigate at 40-50% depletion
- Medium soils (Loamy): Irrigate at 50-60% depletion  
- Heavy soils (Clayey): Irrigate at 60-70% depletion

Tensiometer Readings:
- 0-10 cb: Saturated - Risk of waterlogging
- 10-25 cb: Field capacity - Optimal for most crops
- 25-50 cb: Available water - Irrigate soon
- 50-80 cb: Stress zone - Irrigate immediately
- >80 cb: Permanent wilting point - Severe stress

========================
MONSOON AND RAINFALL MANAGEMENT
========================

Pre-Monsoon:
- Light irrigation to prepare soil
- Conserve moisture with mulching

During Monsoon:
- Skip irrigation if rainfall > 15mm
- Ensure proper drainage
- Monitor for waterlogging

Post-Monsoon:
- Resume scheduled irrigation
- Adjust based on residual soil moisture

========================
WATER QUALITY STANDARDS (ICAR)
========================

Irrigation Water Quality:
- pH: 6.5-8.5 (optimal)
- EC: < 2 dS/m (generally safe)
- SAR: < 10 (low sodium hazard)

Poor quality water impact:
- Reduced water uptake
- Soil salinity issues
- Crop toxicity

================================================================================
DISCLAIMER: These are general guidelines. Farmers should consult local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) for specific recommendations based on local soil, climate, and water availability.
