FAO IRRIGATION GUIDELINES - CROP WATER REQUIREMENTS

========================
RICE (Oryza sativa)
========================

General Water Requirements:
- Rice is a water-intensive crop requiring consistent moisture
- Flooded conditions during vegetative and flowering stages
- Soil moisture should be maintained at 75-85% during critical stages

Growth Stages:

1. EARLY/ESTABLISHMENT (0-30 days)
   - Water requirement: 70-90 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture threshold: 70%
   - Keep fields flooded to 5-10cm depth
   - Critical for seedling establishment

2. VEGETATIVE GROWTH (30-70 days)
   - Water requirement: 90-110 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture threshold: 75%
   - Maintain continuous flooding
   - Peak water demand period

3. FLOWERING/REPRODUCTIVE (70-100 days)
   - Water requirement: 110-130 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture threshold: 80%
   - Most critical stage - DO NOT water stress
   - Continuous standing water essential

Rainfall Adjustments:
- Rainfall > 10mm: Skip irrigation
- Rainfall 5-10mm: Reduce irrigation by 50%
- Rainfall < 5mm: Maintain normal schedule

========================
WHEAT (Triticum aestivum)
========================

General Water Requirements:
- Moderate water requirements compared to rice
- More tolerant to water stress
- Critical periods: tillering, flowering, grain filling

Growth Stages:

1. EARLY/GERMINATION (0-25 days)
   - Water requirement: 35-45 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture threshold: 50%
   - Light irrigation for seed germination

2. VEGETATIVE/TILLERING (25-60 days)
   - Water requirement: 55-65 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture threshold: 55%
   - Important for tiller development

3. FLOWERING/GRAIN FILLING (60-100 days)
   - Water requirement: 75-85 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture threshold: 60%
   - Critical stage - affects yield directly

Rainfall Adjustments:
- Rainfall > 15mm: Skip irrigation
- Rainfall 8-15mm: Reduce by 50%
- Monitor soil moisture regularly

========================
MAIZE/CORN (Zea mays)
========================

General Water Requirements:
- Sensitive to water stress during flowering
- Can tolerate some drought in early stages
- Deep rooting system

Growth Stages:

1. EARLY/SEEDLING (0-30 days)
   - Water requirement: 45-55 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture threshold: 55%
   - Ensure good germination and establishment

2. VEGETATIVE GROWTH (30-60 days)
   - Water requirement: 65-75 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture threshold: 60%
   - Rapid growth period

3. FLOWERING/GRAIN FILLING (60-95 days)
   - Water requirement: 85-95 liters/hectare/day
   - Soil moisture threshold: 65%
   - CRITICAL - any stress severely affects yield
   - Tasseling and silking are most sensitive

Rainfall Adjustments:
- Rainfall > 12mm: Skip irrigation
- Rainfall 6-12mm: Reduce by 40%

========================
GENERAL GUIDELINES
========================

Soil Moisture Management:
- Use tensiometers or moisture sensors
- Irrigate when soil moisture drops below crop-specific threshold
- Avoid over-irrigation - can lead to waterlogging and nutrient leaching

Water Conservation:
- Schedule irrigation during early morning or evening
- Use drip or sprinkler systems when possible
- Mulching can reduce water needs by 20-30%

Climate Considerations:
- Hot, dry weather increases water requirements by 15-20%
- Cool, humid weather reduces by 10-15%
- Wind increases evapotranspiration

Safety Limits:
- Maximum single application: 150 liters/hectare
- Avoid irrigation if heavy rain (>20mm) expected within 24 hours
