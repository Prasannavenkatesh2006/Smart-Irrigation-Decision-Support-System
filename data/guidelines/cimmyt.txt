========================
PRINCIPLES OF EFFICIENT IRRIGATION
========================

Water Use Efficiency (WUE):
- Maximize crop yield per unit of water used
- Target: > 1.0 kg grain per m³ water for cereals
- Conservation agriculture increases WUE by 20-40%

Four Pillars of Efficient Irrigation:
1. Right Amount
2. Right Time
3. Right Method
4. Right Quality

========================
MAIZE IRRIGATION - CIMMYT RECOMMENDATIONS
========================

Maize Water Productivity:

Crop Water Requirement by Stage:
- Vegetative (V6-V12): 50-70 liters/hectare/day
- Reproductive (VT-R1): 80-100 liters/hectare/day  
- Grain Filling (R2-R6): 70-90 liters/hectare/day

Critical Period for Maize:
- 2 weeks before to 2 weeks after flowering
- Silk emergence to early grain fill
- Water stress during this period can reduce yield by 50%

Deficit Irrigation Strategy:
- Apply 80% of full requirement during vegetative
- Apply 100% during flowering and grain fill
- Can save 15-20% total water with minimal yield loss

========================
WHEAT IRRIGATION - PRECISION APPROACH
========================

High-Efficiency Wheat Production:

Optimal Irrigation Schedule:
1. Crown Root Initiation (CRI) - 20 DAS
   - 35-45 liters/hectare/day
   - Ensures strong root system

2. Maximum Tillering - 40-45 DAS  
   - 50-65 liters/hectare/day
   - Determines productive tillers

3. Jointing - 60-65 DAS
   - 60-70 liters/hectare/day
   - Spike formation stage

4. Flowering - 75-80 DAS
   - 75-85 liters/hectare/day
   - Most critical stage

5. Milk Stage - 95-100 DAS
   - 65-75 liters/hectare/day
   - Grain filling

CIMMYT Water Saving Tip:
- Omit irrigation at tillering if soil moisture > 60%
- Save one irrigation per season without yield penalty

========================
RICE - WATER SAVING TECHNOLOGIES
========================

Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):

Protocol:
- Maintain 5cm water until 7-10 days after transplanting
- Allow water to drop to 15cm below surface
- Re-irrigate when field cracks appear
- Repeat cycle throughout season

Benefits:
- Water savings: 15-30%
- Methane emission reduction: 30-70%  
- Root growth improvement
- Yield maintained or increased 5-10%

Safe AWD: Never let water drop below 15cm in:
- Flowering stage (critical!)
- First 2-3 weeks after transplanting

Direct Seeded Rice (DSR):
- No standing water required initially
- Water requirement: 60-80 liters/hectare/day (30% less than transplanted)
- Requires good weed management

========================
CLIMATE-SMART IRRIGATION
========================

Adjustments for Climate Conditions:

Hot and Dry (>35°C, RH<40%):
- Increase irrigation by 20%
- Irrigate early morning or evening
- Consider light, frequent irrigations

Cool and Humid (<25°C, RH>70%):
- Reduce irrigation by 15%
- Risk of fungal diseases if over-watered

Windy Conditions:
- Wind speed > 15 km/h increases evaporation
- Add 10-15% extra water on windy days

========================
IRRIGATION METHODS COMPARISON
========================

Flood/Basin Irrigation:
- Water efficiency: 35-50%
- Suitable for rice, wheat
- High water loss through deep percolation

Furrow Irrigation:
- Water efficiency: 50-65%
- Good for maize, wheat
- Moderate water use

Sprinkler Irrigation:
- Water efficiency: 65-80%
- All crops, especially wheat and maize
- Better distribution, less labor

Drip Irrigation:
- Water efficiency: 80-95%
- Best for high-value crops
- Highest initial cost, lowest water use

========================
RAINFALL INTEGRATION
========================

Making Most of Rainfall:

Light Rain (2-5mm):
- Continue planned irrigation
- Minimal soil moisture addition

Moderate Rain (5-15mm):
- Delay irrigation by 1-2 days
- Monitor soil moisture
- Reduce next irrigation by 50%

Heavy Rain (>15mm):
- Skip next scheduled irrigation
- Ensure good drainage
- Resume when soil moisture depletes to threshold

========================
SOIL MOISTURE DECISION RULES
========================

When to Irrigate (Soil Moisture %):

Rice:
- Early stage: Irrigate if below 70%
- Vegetative: Irrigate if below 75%
- Flowering: Irrigate if below 80%

Wheat:
- Early stage: Irrigate if below 50%
- Vegetative: Irrigate if below 55%
- Flowering: Irrigate if below 60%

Maize:
- Early stage: Irrigate if below 55%
- Vegetative: Irrigate if below 60%
- Flowering: Irrigate if below 65%

Safety Rule: Never exceed 150 liters/hectare/day single application

SUSTAINABLE IRRIGATION PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

1. Minimize Water Waste
   - Fix leaks immediately
   - Use efficient application methods
   - Avoid over-irrigation

2. Maintain Soil Health
   - Prevent waterlogging  
   - Maintain organic matter
   - Use crop rotation

3. Monitor and Adapt
   - Use soil moisture sensors when possible
   - Keep irrigation records
   - Adjust based on crop response

4. Conserve for Future
   - Rainwater harvesting
   - Groundwater recharge
   - Community water management

================================================================================
DISCLAIMER: Farming is context-specific. These are evidence-based guidelines but should be adapted to local conditions, farmer experience, and available resources.
